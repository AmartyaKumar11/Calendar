# Calender Prediction system 
This repository contains a C++ program called the Virtual Calendar Day Calculator. It calculates the day of the week for a given date entered by the user.

# Features
User-friendly interface: The program prompts users to enter a date in the DD MM YYYY format (e.g., 27 06 2024).
Comprehensive date validation: The program validates the entered date for various aspects:
Month range (1-12)
Day range (1-31, considering days in each month and leap years)
Leap year validity (February cannot have 29 days in non-leap years)
Year (positive integer)
Clear output: The program displays the day of the week for the entered valid date.
Improved code readability: The code utilizes meaningful variable names, comments, and functions for better understanding and maintainability.
# Usage : 
Clone or download this repository.
Compile the C++ code using a suitable compiler (e.g., g++).
Run the compiled executable.
Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a date in the MM DD YYYY format.
The program will validate the date and display the day of the week, or provide informative messages for invalid entries.

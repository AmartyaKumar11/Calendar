Day range (1-31, considering days in each month and leap years)

Leap year validity (February cannot have 29 days in non-leap years)

Year (positive integer)

Clear output: The program displays the day of the week for the entered valid date.

Improved code readability: The code utilizes meaningful variable names, comments, and functions for better understanding and maintainability.
# Usage : 
Clone or download this repository.
Compile the C++ code using a suitable compiler (e.g., g++).
Run the compiled executable.
Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a date in the MM DD YYYY format.
